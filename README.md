# Emoji Telepathy
Emoji Telepathy is a game where you try to hone-in on a single emoji with another player. It was made for the [Hack Club High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/) event, and is designed to run in serverless environments.

If there are no players online, after some time, the match-making system will automagically create a bot player for you. The bot uses a simple algorithm to try and predict what you'll choose next! You can see how it works [here](https://github.com/ascpixi/emoji-telepathy/blob/master/src/app/api/bot.ts).
